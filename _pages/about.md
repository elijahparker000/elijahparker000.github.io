Currently, I'm an electrical engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. I'm also pursuing my masters in A.I. at JHU. I'll try to keep this website up to date with major projects and stuff. Right now I'm working a new version of my JeopardyPi project which will hopefully make it more user friendly and visually appealing.
